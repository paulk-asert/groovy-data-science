## Running locally

Clone the repo. You can then run scripts from the command-line (various gradle tasks
have been defined to make this easy) or within your favorite IDE or the Groovy Console.

Details for cloning and showing available gradle tasks:

<details open>
<summary>Linux/MacOS</summary>

```
$ git clone https://github.com/paulk-asert/groovy-data-science.git
...
$ ./gradlew tasks
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>Windows</summary>

Assuming you have git installed:

```
> git clone https://github.com/paulk-asert/groovy-data-science.git
...
> gradlew tasks
```
</details>

Make sure you have Java installed prior to running the examples.

Alternatively, run any of the scripts directly in the IDE.
