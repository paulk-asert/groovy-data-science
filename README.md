# Data Science with Groovy

Groovy is a powerful multi-paradigm programming language for the JVM that offers a wealth of features that make it ideal for many data science and big data scenarios.

* Groovy has a dynamic nature like Python, which means that it is very powerful, easy to learn, and productive. The language gets out of the way and lets data scientists write their algorithms naturally.

* Groovy has a static nature like Java and Kotlin, which makes it fast when needed. Its close alignment with Java means that you can often just cut-and-paste the Java examples from various big data solutions and they’ll work just fine in Groovy.

* Groovy has first-class functional support, meaning that it offers features and allows solutions similar to Scala. Functional and stream processing with immutable data structures can offer many advantages when working in parallel processing or clustered environments.

This repo has examples of using Groovy with various Data Science and related libraries.

Topics covered include:

* Dataframes and visualization
* Linear regression
* Clustering
* Classification
* Natural language processing
* Digit and object detection with neural networks and deep learning

### Running the examples

You have 4 options to run many of the examples:

* [running locally](docs/RunningLocal.md) on the command-line or in an IDE
* [running via Gitpod](docs/RunningGitpod.md)
* [running as a Jupyter/BeakerX](docs/RunningBeakerX.md) notebook
* [running in the Groovy Console or Groovy Web Console](docs/RunningConsole.md)

### Requirements

Most examples have been tested with at least JDK8 and JDK11.
Examples which run with JDK11, typically also work with later JDK versions.
Some examples have more specific requirements, e.g. JDK8 with JavaFX or JDK11+ only.
Such requirements are noted in the specific README docs for each subproject.

## Scented candles and COVID-19

When we hypothesize about a trend,
it can be interesting to see whether any data backs up our hypothesis.
To do that, we want to be able to easily obtain data in a form we can
analyse and visualize. This example illustrates doing just that.

![Scented candles](docs/images/candles.png)

All the details can be found in the [Candles subproject](subprojects/Candles/).
Options are available to run the examples on the command-line or in your favourite IDE.

## House price prediction with linear regression

Linear regression will enable us to find a "best fit" linear relationship between some properties or features of interest.
Ordinary least squares finds such a relationship by minimising residual errors.
This example uses linear regression to explore predicting house prices from a number
of other features such as number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms,
living space etc.
The examples illustrate several alternative dataframe libraries,
several CSV handling libraries, and a number of visualization options.

Options are available to run the examples on the command-line, in your favourite IDE, using Gitpod,
or using a Jupyter/BeakerX notebook.

## Whiskey clustering with K-means and other algorithms

K-means is the most common form of “centroid” clustering.
Unlike classification, clustering is an unsupervised learning method.
The categories are not predetermined but instead represent natural groupings
which are found as part of the clustering process.
Members of each cluster should be similar to each other and
different from the members of the other clusters.
The K represents the number of clusters to find.
This example uses K-means to look at grouping together
similar Whiskey drinks from various distilleries.

## Digit recognition using neural networks

An artificial neural network consists of layers of nodes which talk to other nodes based on weights and thresholds.
It mimics to some degree the way in which neurons are interconnected in biological neural networks.
Neural networks are particularly good when some degree of fuzziness is required in the processing activity.
They are popular for speech and image recognition and medical diagnosis among other areas.
This example looks at using neural networks for digit recognition.

![Running Gui.groovy](docs/images/mnist_gui.png)

More details can be found in the [Mnist](subprojects/Mnist/) subproject.
It contains examples using handwritten neural networks with
[Apache Commons Math] used for matrix calculations
and multilayer perceptron examples using [Eclipse DeepLearning4J].
There is also a logistic regression example using [Tribuo].

## Companion examples

While not always regarded as data science specific technologies,
linear programming and constraint programming can be useful in numerous scenarios:

* linear and mixed-integer programming can be used to solve various optimization problems

* constraint programming is useful when problems can be expressed
in terms of high-level constraints

Related libraries may cover both these topics and possibly other
additional problems like scheduling, bin packing and graph algorithms.

### Diet optimization

Optimization algorithms aren't exclusively related just to data science but
never-the-less can crop up quite often. This case study looks at using linear programming
to optimize a diet problem. Given the cost and nutrition values of various
foods, can we minimise the cost of a diet but still meet various
health requirements for the diet.

### Cryptarithmetic puzzle with constraint programming

While not often spoken about as a classic data science technique,
constraint programming can be a very useful tool in numerous scenarios.
It allows users to specify characteristics of a problem as high-level constraints
and then invoke a solution engine which will apply back-tracking,
constraint propagation and perhaps heuristics to find a solution matching the constraints.
This example solves a classic cryptarithmetic puzzle using constraint programming.
The Groovy solution is contrasted with brute-force approaches and solutions in other JVM languages.
