political democracy presupposes a radical decentralisation physical or administrative within a confederal society which by itself should enhance its environmentally friendly character furthermore political democracy would create a public space a fact which would significantly reduce the appeal of materialism by providing a new meaning of life to fill the existential void that the present consumer society creates economic democracy replaces the dynamics of the capitalist market economy leading to growth per se with a new social dynamic aiming at the satisfaction of demos needs if the satisfaction of demotic needs does not depend as at present on the continuous expansion of production to cover the needs that the market system itself creates and if society is reintegrated with the economy then there is no reason why the present instrumentalist view of nature will continue conditioning human behaviour particularly so since unlike socialist models which are centralist the aim of production in an inclusive democracy is not economic growth but the satisfaction of the basic needs of the community and those non-basic needs for which members of the community express

most artificial market proponents reject the traditional socialist adoption of the labour theory of value as they believe it cannot be used as the basis for allocating scarce resources the reason given is that even if the labour theory of value can give a partial indication of availability of resources it certainly cannot be used as a means to express consumers’ preferences thus they feel that the labour theory of value cannot serve as the basis for an allocative system that aims at both meeting needs and at the same time securing consumer sovereignty and freedom of choice instead the model proposed here is in fact a system of rationing which is based on the revealed consumers’ preferences on the one hand and resource availability on the other
